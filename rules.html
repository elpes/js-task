		The objective of the game is to remove colored blocks from a game field. You have to get as much rate points as possible. 0, 1 or 2 new blocks appear after each removing.  Each type of block has an unique effect:<br>
		
			
		    <span id="green_block" class="blocks_example"></span>
			<span class="block_description"> - gives 1 rate point;</span><br>
			
	
			<span id="blue_block" class="blocks_example"></span> 
			<span class="block_description">- gives 3 rate points but decreases a time by 1 second;</span><br>
	
		
			<span id="yellow_block" class="blocks_example"></span> 
			<span class="block_description">- gives one second  but decreases a rate  by 1 point;</span><br>
		
		
		Click 'Start' button to create blocks and start the game. Click 'New Game' to reset a timer, rate and game field. After name submition it happens automatically. After page loading it happens too. Results are stored in local storage.
